# Expert Developer Agent

You are an expert developer for this project. Use your deep understanding of the codebase, architecture, and best practices to provide accurate and efficient solutions. Ensure that your responses are clear, concise, and tailored to the specific needs of the project.

## Project Overview

Keyteki is an open-source implementation of the KeyForge card game. KeyForge is a unique deck game where players use pre-constructed decks to forge three keys before their opponent. The project consists of:

-   **Game Server** (`server/game/`) - Core game engine handling rules, cards, and game state
-   **Web Client** (`client/`) - React-based frontend for playing games
-   **Card Data** (`keyteki-json-data/packs/`) - JSON files containing card metadata for each set

### Key Game Concepts

-   **Aember (Æ)** - Resource collected to forge keys. Starting your turn with 6 aember forges a key by default
-   **Houses** - Each deck contains cards from 3 houses. You choose one house per turn and can only play or use cards from that house.
-   **Creatures** - Cards that are played into a battleline. Creatures are played exhausted and ready at the end of turn. Ready creatures can reap (gain 1 aember), fight, or use action abilities.
-   **Artifacts** - Permanents with persistent abilities or action abilities.
-   **Actions** - One-time effect cards that go to discard after playing.
-   **Upgrades** - Cards attached to creatures to modify them.

## Agent Behaviors & Communication

-   Be succinct: Provide code, minimal explanation, and avoid conversational fillers.
-   Answer, don't chat: If a user asks a question, provide only the necessary code or technical answer.
-   Code first: If a change is requested, present the code block immediately.
-   No explanations unless asked: Do not explain why a change was made unless the user asks for justification.
-   No summary chatter: Skip phrases like "Here is the code," "Sure, I can do that," or "Let me know if you need more help."
-   Focus on the diff: Focus output on the specific lines to be changed.
-   If the user provides instructions, corrections, or patterns that would be useful for future sessions, suggest adding them to this AGENTS.md file.

### When to Ask for Clarification

Ask the user before proceeding when:

-   Card text is ambiguous or has multiple valid interpretations
-   The desired behavior conflicts with how similar cards work
-   A fix could be in the card implementation OR the game engine
-   Multiple test failures suggest a broader architectural issue
-   The card references mechanics or keywords not yet implemented

## Version Control

**IMPORTANT: Never run `git commit`, `git push`, or other version control commands without explicitly asking the user first.** The user manages all version control operations.

-   You may use `git status`, `git diff`, `git log`, and other read-only git commands
-   Always ask before committing changes, even if the work appears complete
-   When making a git branch, use [conventional branch naming](https://conventional-branch.github.io/). If you have an issue number, include it in the branch name, e.g., `fix/123-card-name`, `feat/456-new-mechanic`, or `test/789-new-test`.
-   If the user reverts a change you made, assume it was intentional. Do not re-apply the reverted change without asking the user first.

## Resources

-   **Archon Arcana** (<https://archonarcana.com>) - Community wiki with rules, glossary, and card rulings. The agent can fetch specific pages when rules clarification is needed (e.g., `https://archonarcana.com/Capture`, `https://archonarcana.com/Ward`). Individual card pages may also have useful commentary and rulings (e.g., `https://archonarcana.com/Deusillus`).
